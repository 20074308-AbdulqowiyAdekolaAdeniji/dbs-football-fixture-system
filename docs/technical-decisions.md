### Frontend Framework Decision
After today's class discussion with Paul, clarified that React should be used for the frontend instead of vanilla JavaScript. 

**Rationale:**
- React provides better component structure
- Easier state management for CRUD operations
- Better aligns with modern web development practices
- Mentioned in assignment brief as preferred option

**Impact:**
- Backend (Node.js, Express, SQLite) remains unchanged
- Will rebuild frontend using React
- Database schema and API design stay the same

**Next Steps:**
- Set up React development environment
- Create React components for fixture management
- Implement same functionality in React framework
